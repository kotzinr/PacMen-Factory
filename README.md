# pacmen
##Factory for making pacmen

**Purpose:** Pac-Man moves back and forth within a window. The intent of this project was to implement the setInterval() method and to learn to write code to reverse the direction of a moving image using screen edge detection.

**Installation:** Click the link https://shrewd-puma-ht1v-8080.nt.run/ to see Pac-Man chomp from right to left on repeat

**Usage:** displays alternating images of Pac-Man and moves using setInterval() method, reverses direction using screen edge detection. Can be used to see x-axis screen edge detection code using JavaScript.

**Support:** N/A at this time

**Roadmap:** I would like to add some of the ghost characters to interact with Pac-Man in the future and to add different dimensions to their movement.

**License information:** MIT XPro code and image resources for all files listed

You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.
